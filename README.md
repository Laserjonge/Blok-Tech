# Axeleration | Blok-Tech

## About
Axeleration is a matching application to connect driving instructors with students and vice versa. The feature that I have worked on is filtering, you already can choose if you would like to take lessons form al male or female instructor and you can choose to take lessons for a car- motor- or scooter drivers license. 

## Usage
To sign-up choose if you are a student or an instructor go on creating your profile by adding something about your personality, where you are looking for and add some pictures. After signing-up you can start swiping, it works like most dating apps: swiping to the left means DISLIKE, swiping to the right means LIKE, there's also an SAVE button to keep the person an take a look at it later. When two persons swiped each other to the right there arises a match so they can chat to learn more about each other, if it"s a success they can make an appointment for the fist driving lesson.
